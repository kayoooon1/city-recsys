# Finding Home: Exploring the Best Cities to Live In     
Which city is the best to live in? This project aims to explore the association between different features of cities and their impact on liveability. We start by exploring datasets like suicide rates and the hours of sunshine by cities/countries. Later, we plan to model a “good” city based on more features, such as average temperature, green spaces, criminal rate, traffic jams, cost of living etc. We define the likelihood of a ”good” city, given a feature by assuming the best range of values for our feature set based on past studies. Then, we create a model that calculates the probability that a given city is the best city to live in, given our assumed ”best range” values. We plan to make interactive plots where the ”best range” values can be modified. Here, the users can decide their own “best parameters” for finding the “best” city and get personalized rankings.
