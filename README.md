# Finding Home: Exploring the Best Cities to Live In    
## Project Overview
Which city is the best to live in? This project delves into the exploration of various features about different cities and the impact on their liveability. Some of those features are the average temperature, cost of living and average commuting time. Based on the most desirable values regarding those features, we define the likelihood of a city being ”good” to live in. Based on a unsupervised learning model, we classify the cities in order of their overall liveability based on user preferences regarding the beforementioned features. This is done through customizable parameters, enabling the user to interact with the model and therefore, creating personalized rankings.
