# Finding Home: Exploring the Best Cities to Live In    
## Project Overview
Which city is the best to live in? This project delves into the exploration of various features about different cities and the impact on their liveability. Some of those features are the average temperature, cost of living and average commuting time. Based on the most desirable values regarding those features, we define the likelihood of a city being ”good” to live in. Based on a unsupervised learning model, we classify the cities in order of their overall liveability based on user preferences regarding the beforementioned features. This is done through customizable parameters, enabling the user to interact with the model and therefore, creating personalized rankings.

## Repository Structure

EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis files. Here you will find the descriptive statistics and other preliminary tests

all_data: Contains the combined dataset and the code used for the merging process. We collected the data from various openly available sources. Those datasets were merged and subsequently standardized. Links to the data: ....

Modeling: Contains Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis we have tested to construct our model and the visualizations of our data. The models we have used are the following: ....

streamlit: Here we have stored all the files necessary to run our interactive stramlit plots. Link to the Streamlit app ...

## Requirements
Python Version: 3.10
Required Libraries: List the necessary Python libraries with versions, e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, etc.
